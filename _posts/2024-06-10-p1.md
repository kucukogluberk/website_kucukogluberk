In this post, we are designing a digital signal processing circuit on a Basys3 board. We aim the circuit to run in real-time.

Basys3 board already has a built-in ADC. This is how we get the audio input.
Basys3 board does not have an audio DAC on board. There are tricks to make it work with 4-bit DAC that is responsible for the VGA output. However, this is not suitable for (high quality) audio applications.

Therefore we are using an external DAC board. Link to the DAC board can be found here: link

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
