In this post, I am sharing what I learned from Levent Onural on designing a digital filter. I wanted this to be in his memory (tidy this paragraph!)

Designing a digital filter is very interesting because:
+ This design method is not very precise, but it's super intuitive.
+ For some reason, it's not common knowledge.
+ It boils downto designing p-th order difference equations, and this is directly related to ARMA processes, which has deep roots in time series analysis, and other finance related topics.
