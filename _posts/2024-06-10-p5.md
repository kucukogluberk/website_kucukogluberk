In this post we are designing a scan generator for a Scanning Transmission Electron Microscope, also known as STEM.

It can cost thousands of dollars to buy a scan generator. I think in our lab we bought one for 40k USD. This price includes a powerful computer to accompany the scan generator. Still, the scan generator is just a DAC board. The DAC board itself can be bought for around
